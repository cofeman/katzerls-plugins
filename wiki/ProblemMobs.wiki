#summary Mobs with Problems

= Mobs with Problems =

Sometimes the Bot has Problems to kill Vyragosa, Blazewing or Bloodseeker.

Vyragosa is a flying Caster Mob. Rogues and Warrior often have Problems to kill him, because the CCs can't handle such a fight. It often results in a couple of deaths for these Classes. If you have Problems with Vyragosa you should uncheck *"kill Vyragosa"*, so the Bot will ignore her.

Blazewing is a very very fast flying Rare Mob. Often the Bot has no chance to reach him and gets stuck while trying to follow him.
Only Check "kill Blazewing" if you belief your Bot could kill him.

Bloodseeker is also a flying Mob, your Toon only can kill him with valid Slowfall. Otherwise he will fall to Death. You could also activate, that the Bot will only catch him without killing him.
