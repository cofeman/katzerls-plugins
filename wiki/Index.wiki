=== Rare Mob Killer -Plugin - Version 4.x ===

*First:* Botting is against the Rules, so bot carefull and don't get slaphappy if you use this Plugin with your Main Account. Circle around 24/7 is very risky.  Good Luck in Hunting everybody 

*This Plugin will help you hunt Rare Mobs like TLPD and Poseidus - Also implemented:*
  * Rare Mobs of Mists of Pandaria
  * Blingtron
  * Camel Figurines including Dormus Kill
  * Another Mans Treasure
  * *Alert* for Footprints of tameable Pandaria Rares
  * Archievement Bloody Rare
  * Archievement Frostbitten
  * Cataclysm Rare Mobs
  * Dark Soil and Onyx Eggs
  * mostly other Things you search for, you can set up in the GUI or in the Files of the config Folder --> see ConfigFiles

If your WOW notices a hunted Mob/Object, this Plugin will take control over your toon and flys or walks to the Mob and aggro him with an spell.

If falling down from the Mount (while hunting flying Mobs) the implemented Slowfall-Part, if enabled, will cast slowfall, so you wont die. Ones Aggro your CC will bring it to the end and loot the Mob. The Plugin also plays a Sound if found a hunted Mob.

For your Security and to look more human while camping I also implemented
  * a Wisper-Alert inkl Battle Net Wispers
  * a Guildmessage-Alert inkl Officers Channel
  * a ANTI AFK which presses a Key every 3 - 14 Minutes to avoid AFK like a Human
  * an Option to not collect Objects with other Players around

You could use this Plugin beside Gathering, Arching and Leveling.
If running this Plugin with Botbase GB2 you also need a Profile.
