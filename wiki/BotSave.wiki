#summary How to Bot save

= Bot Save =

*First:* We all know Botting is against the Rules.

I know many People use this Plugin to get the Rare Mounts on there Main accounts. *Please* don't get slaphappy if you use this Plugin on your Main. There are many ways to look like normal Player while camping special Rares. Just take some Minutes and think about how would you camp a this Rare Mob without Bot and try to Set up your Bot that he also acts like you would do.

  * Circle around 24/7 the exact same Route over and over for days or maybe also for hours is very risky. Take some breaks between camping sessions.
  * If you don't need it, don't let your Bot farm herbs and ore beside camping. He will look like a farmer and after some days or maybe just some hours surely he will attract attention of others.
  * If you want to play save, don't leave your Bot alone at home. Turn the Alerts on and your Boxes loud to wake up, if the Bot gets into trouble.
  * In my Opinion it is more humenlike to use a Profile with only one fix Hotspot to camp special Rares. If you additional check "ANTI-AFK" on the Second Tap of Rarekiller you will look like a Person who is watching TV beside camping.
