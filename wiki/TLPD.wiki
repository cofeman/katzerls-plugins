=== Test the Plugin for TLPD ===
If you want to Hunt TLPD its a good idea to test the Plugin before going AFK:

  * Enable Hunt by ID and write 33687 in the Textbox and Save. Now the Plugin will also hunt Chillmaw in Icecrown. If you want to use Snowfall Lager as Slowfall ability then you must test with the Stormpeak Wyrms, ID 29753.
  * Setup your Slowfall, Pullrange/-spell, Slowfalltimer and all the other stuff. Use the [http://www.thebuddyforum.com/attachments/honorbuddy-forum/submitted-profiles/neutral/15582d1295802188-%5Bn%5D%5Bcamper%5D-never-afk-again-camper-1-0.xml Camperprofile (link)] with Grindbot and start. Then fly manually near the point were Chillmaw or the Stormpeakwyrms are.
  * If everything works right the bot will fly to the hunted Mob, pull him and use the slowfall if he is higher above the ground and then finally kills him.

If this works you can go hunting.
