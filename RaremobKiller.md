# Hunt by ID #

Here you can insert a Mob Id and the Bot will pull this Mob if he found him. You found the Mob-Id if you search the Mob on [wowhead](http://www.wowhead.com) and look at the Adress of the Site of your searched Mob:

For example Poseidus:
  * ID: 50005
  * WOWHead Site: http://www.wowhead.com/npc=50005
