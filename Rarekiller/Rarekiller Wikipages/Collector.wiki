#summary Camel Figurine Config.

= Collector =
  * *"Collect Camel Figurines"*: He will collect Camel Figurines in Uldum if he founds one
  * With *"Give a Dust Figurine just one try to collect"* I try to fixed some bottish behavior, because he has sometimes Problems to collect the Dust Camel (Not the Porting one). If Checked he will try to collect the Dust Figurine once and then blacklist it for 2 Minutes to go ahead instead of collecting her several times, which might look bottish.
  * With *"Pull Dormus"* he will move to Dormus and try to Pull him in his Area so HB will kill and loot him. *HINT:* Only enable it, if you are sure your Toon can handle the Fight without your help.
  * *Collect Raptor Nest:* Collect Raptor Nests for little Raptor Pets
  
*Please Notice:* The Part "Pull Dormus" is still under Construction because of the really Rare Testobjects. I can't give you a garantee that this Parts works correct, but it is a chance to get the Camel. Although flying to the Figurine and Collect them and the Alert works for sure.
