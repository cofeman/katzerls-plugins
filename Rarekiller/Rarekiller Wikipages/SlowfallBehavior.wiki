#summary config Slowfall Behavior.

= Slowfall Behavior =

Especially for hunting flying Mobs like Timelost Protodrake you need a Slowfall Behavior. If you don't use this and hunt this Mob in Flying Mode you will probably die because of the falling damage.

You could choose between these Slowfall Behaviors:
  * Use a special Slowfall Spell
  * Use Slowfall Cloak
  * Use Slowfall Item
Per Default he will also try to use:
  * Levitate if you are a Priest
  * Slow Fall if you are a Mage
  * Flight Forms if you are a Druid

You could choose more then one Bahavior. The Bot will try to use the ones which are not on Cooldown until he gets a Slowfall Aura.

*HINT:* Here you have to write the name of a 
  * ... Slowfall *Item* in your client language 
  * ... but a Slowfall *Spell* in english. !!!

=== Falling Timer ===
You could also set change a Timer in mms. This is the Time how long the Char will fall before the Bot uses Slowfall. If you set him to 0 the Char will use Slowfall even if dismounting. If you set it to 1000 he will wait 1 sec, for example.

Try which Time works for you the Best. If you meet TLPD your Toon will use a special Quick Slowfall to make sure your Toon will not die.
